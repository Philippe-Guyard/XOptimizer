## Giuseppe Cognata
This week I:
- Finished implementing the functions to compute optimal routings in the general inventory cases
- Began writing some tests for these functions

Next week I:
- Will finish testing these functions and more
- Will fix bugs and work on further generalizations

## Mark Daychman
This week I:
- Improved the A* path finding algorithm (heap instead of an unordered_set)

Next week I:
- Will begin to implement the serialisation for the map object so that the distance matrix doesn't have to be recalculated between sessions. 

## Pedro Cabral
This week I:
- Completed the implementation of the main algorithms necessary for the application to work.
- Wrote several tests to check if everything was working.

Next Week I:
- Will Optimize the algorithms that can be optimized.

## Zarko Bulic
This week I:
- Implemented the methods for creating and destroying blossoms.
- Fixed bugs

Next Week I:
- Implement the update of dual cost
- Continue fixing bugs

## Philippe Guyard
This Week I:
  - Fixed git issues in the core-algo team
  - Added a callback to track the amount of bytes downloaded of a map

Next Week I:
  - Will merge the frontend into our app
  - Put the parsing in a separate thread

## Johanna Ulin 
This Week I:
  - Worked on the development of the filestorage class. It has been a struggle as it seems to be quite OS based but I will hopefully finsih it next week.  
  - Werked on tests for the filestorage and interaction service.

Next Week I:
  - Will finish the implementation of the filestorage class.
  - Will work further on the tests of the filestorage class. 

## Vilius Tubinas
This Week I:
  - Fixed the problems related with choosing a city and department.
  - Worked on the responsiveness of the dashboard.
  - Created the functions that allow for loading pages to be displayed while functions are running.

Next Week I:
  - Work together with Nossaiba to add maps to the current product.
  - Connect our work with the rest of the project.

## Nguyen Doan Dai
This week I:
- Fixed graph generator with Eulerian circuits
- Fixed various minor issues in test generators, now with partially running code base in development
- Added tests for brute force methods for Travelling Salesman Problem
- Refactor class RandomGraph for generating testing graph
Next week I:
- Finalize the test cases 

## Nossaiba Kheiri:
This week: 
- Redesigned the GUI with Vilius to optimize the user experience 
- Fixed some merging issues in the frontend
- Discussed the problem of updating the map preview 
- 
Next week : 
- Rediscuss the map preview setting with vilius 
- find a way to update the map following the coordinates of the optimisation
