## Johanna Ulin
This week I:
-I finally finished the implementation of the filestorage class. It was more of a struggle then I expected and was a lot if trial and error.
-I worked on the tests for the interaction service.
Next week I:
- Will finalize the tests.
- Will work on my christmas task: "Johannas christmas task: implement method for map class to find closest node."
