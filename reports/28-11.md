## Mert Unsal
This week I:
- Implemented a dynamic programming based minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle algorithm that works in O(n^2 2^n) to be applied in cases with small numbers
- Coded a Map object and its constructor to be able to load the map into a graph and find minimum weight between the orders
- Wrote tests to check the correctness of the codes
- Did lots of bug fixes in the rest of the team's codes
- Coded a brute force nearest neighbour's algorithm

Next week I:
- Finish the Map object 
- Coded Dijkstra's Algorithm to find minimum path between all vertices using Fibonacci Heap for a run time of O(n^2 log(n))
- Write tests and continue bugfixing

## Mark Daychman
This week I:
- Implemented the testing file for the interaction service (download and file_to_order)
- Learned more Qt modules like QDir, QVector, QVariant, QCryptographicHash (for the download file checksum) and Qt Resource system 
- Learned about copy constructors

Next week I:
- Write the tests for the pbf-parser (if complete) + tests for csv downloader (if needed)
- Work on finishing the merger of the interaction service

## Zarko Bulic
This week I:
- Coded the start of the blossom weighted algorithm. I created the Matching class and wrote the header. 
- I implemented the constructors of the class as well as couple of methods I will use later

Next week I:
-Continue with the implementation of the algorithm
- Write the first of three updating cases to alternating tree


## Vilius Tubinas
This week I:
- Looked into ways to modernize the design of our UI and decided on a solution we will use.
- Finished merging with the interaction service.

Next week I:
- Will merge my part of the project with the other person working on frontend
- Implement a loading bar to indicate the stage of algorythm
- Implement the Qt widgets-based implementation of the Material Design specification.
- Restructure the dashboard into multiple pages.

## Pedro Cabral
This week I:
  - Coded clustering algorithms and handled the case of the problem with multiple inventories.
Next week I:
  - Will fix bugs and write handling exceptions code.

## Giuseppe Cognata
This week I:
  - Fixed some issues in the k-means clustering algorithm, and optimized some of its features

Next week I:
  - Will finish smoothening the implementation of the k-means algorithm
  - Will work on fixing bugs

## Johanna Ulin
This week I: 
- Implemented the class FileStorage, where PBF and CSV files will be stored in a dictionary using QMap, pushed to the Interaction Service branch. 
- Implemented functions using QMap and QFileinfo 
- Tested FileStorage functions manually. 

Next week I: 
- Will implment further functionality to the Interaction sevrice part, what functionality is yetto be determined with Philippe on the lecture on monday. 

## Riho Marten Pallum
  This week I:
  - Fixed the header file for csv_parsing in the interaction service part of the project
  - Further tested the csv_parsing
  Next week I:
  - Will implement the kdftree class
