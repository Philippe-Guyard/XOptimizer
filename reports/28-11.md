## Mark Daychman
This week I:
- Implemented the testing file for the interaction service (download and file_to_order)
- Learned more Qt modules like QDir, QVector, QVariant, QCryptographicHash (for the download file checksum) and Qt Resource system 
- Learned about copy constructors

Next week I:
- Write the tests for the pbf-parser (if complete) + tests for csv downloader (if needed)
- Work on finishing the merger of the interaction service

## Zarko Bulic
This week I:
- Coded the start of the blossom weighted algorithm. I created the Matching class and wrote the header. 
- I implemented the constructors of the class as well as couple of methods I will use later

Next week I:
-Continue with the implementation of the algorithm
- Write the first of three updating cases to alternating tree


## Vilius Tubinas
This week I:
- Looked into ways to modernize the design of our UI and decided on a solution we will use.
- Finished merging with the interaction service.

Next week I:
- Will merge my part of the project with the other person working on frontend
- Implement a loading bar to indicate the stage of algorythm
- Implement the Qt widgets-based implementation of the Material Design specification.

## Pedro Cabral
This week I:
  - Coded clustering algorithms and handled the case of the problem with multiple inventories.
Next week I:
  - Will fix bugs and write handling exceptions code.

## Giuseppe Cognata
This week I:
  - Fixed some issues in the k-means clustering algorithm, and optimized some of its features

Next week I:
  - Will finish smoothening the implementation of the k-means algorithm
  - Will work on fixing bugs
