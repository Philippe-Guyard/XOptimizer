## Mert Unsal
This week I:
 - Finalized coding the Map class's constructor and Dijkstra's algorithm to finding minimum paths.
 - Organized the file structure and made shifts in the team architecture to make sure everybody has some work to do.
 - Wrote tests and continue bugfixing.
 Next week I will:
 - Download an actual map from the database, parse it into a map object by merging codes of different teams.
 - Run an example of Christofides' algorithm on at least one example and test the results.
 - Continue the merging process.

## Pedro Cabral
This week I:
 - Created new files with more algorithms that will allow an easier implementation of our functions.
 - Fixed some bugs.
Next week I:
  - Will fix more bugs.
  - Will change this new algorithms to complete the functions that are still missing.

## Zarko Bulic
This week I:
- Fixed bugs in the first part of the class.
- Implemented the first update (expand) case for the alternating tree.

Next week I:

-Will complete the second case of alternating tree.
-Will fix more bugs.


## Johanna Ulin 
This week I:
- Helped with implementation of KD Trees.
- wrote tests for file_storage class.
- started working on the test.cpp file. 

Next week i: 
- will finish the test.cpp file for all of the interaction service. 
- implement general tests for downloader, parser, etc. 
- Will investigate further development possibilities.
