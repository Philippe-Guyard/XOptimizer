- Coded classes and subclasses such as Edge, Vertex, VertexData which can be found in the core-algo branch as a basis to our optimization library. 
- Created the GitHub README.md file and made sure everyone can connect to the repository as well as Trello. 
- Worked on team organization as the project leader and assigned tasks to make sure everyone has work to do.
- Next week, I'm going to finish the implementation of the core algorithm classes and make sure we can download the map in our Graph class.
