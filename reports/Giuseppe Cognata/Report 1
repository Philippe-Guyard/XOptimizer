Giuseppe Cognata Individual Report for the week 01 - 07/11

This Week:
Defined rigorously the problem statement the team will solve alongside the other team members
Read the documentation on the approximation algorithm we will implement to solve our instance of metric TSP
Began working on the implementation of the fisrt part of the algorithm i.e. finding a minimum spanning tree for the graph

Next Week:
Polish out the fundamental class structures for graphs edges etc
Will finish the implementation of the minimum spanning tree and, with the rest of the team, hopefully completely implement the algorithm's core features
