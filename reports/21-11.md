# Reports for the week ending 21/11/2021


## Vilius Tubinas
This week I: 
- Implemented the ability to upload and edit csv files
- Made it that the csv file is saved with all the changes when the user presses "Submit".
- Started merging with interaction service

Next week: 
- Finish merging with interaction service
- Look into ways to modernize the design

## Nguyen Doan Dai
This weak I:
- successfully ran and compiled the implemented methods and tests, found the remaining issues and resolved them,
- built a CD/CI pipeline on GitHub, automatized testing process,
- independently implemented parser to Blossom V library,
- added tests for finding Minimum-cost Perfect Matching, as well as Minimum-cost Near-perfect matching,
- adjusted configuration of Kolmorogov's Blossom V library for the parser and for testing purpose,
- moved tested functionalities from sandbox `core-algo/temp` to permanent code base `core-algo/src`,

Next week I plan to:
- add more test cases regarding edge cases of class methods,
- implemented method generating random graph with known solution for Travelling Salesman Problem, 
- add tests for finding Euleurian cycle and Christofide's algorithm,

## Giuseppe Cognata
This week I:
- decided on the approach for further generalizations of our problem with the algorithm team, chose the relevant algorithms to implement these generalizations
- began implementing the k-means clustering algorithm using randomized initialization to optimize performance

Next week I plan to:
- finish the implementation of the k-means algorithm, which will allow us considerable generalization
- work on tidying up the code of the algorithms team
- work with the rest of the team to merge the various algos to solve a general instance of our problem
