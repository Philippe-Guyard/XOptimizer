# Reports for the week ending 21/11/2021


## Vilius Tubinas
This week I: 
- Implemented the ability to upload and edit csv files
- Made it that the csv file is saved with all the changes when the user presses "Submit".
- Started merging with interaction service

Next week: 
- Finish merging with interaction service
- Look into ways to modernize the design

## Nguyen Doan Dai
This weak I:
- successfully ran and compiled the implemented methods and tests, found the remaining issues and resolved them,
- built a CD/CI pipeline on GitHub, automatized testing process,
- independently implemented parser to Blossom V library,
- added tests for finding Minimum-cost Perfect Matching, as well as Minimum-cost Near-perfect matching,
- adjusted configuration of Kolmorogov's Blossom V library for the parser and for testing purpose,
- moved tested functionalities from sandbox `core-algo/temp` to permanent code base `core-algo/src`,

Next week I plan to:
- add more test cases regarding edge cases of class methods,
- implemented method generating random graph with known solution for Travelling Salesman Problem, 
- add tests for finding Euleurian cycle and Christofide's algorithm,

## Mark Daychman
This week I:
- finished merging the wrapper class.
- updated the method .searchCSV. Now the method doesn't "pollute" the table with unncessary data. It only adds the longitude and latitude. It also ignores every column except for "addresse" in the .svg file when it makes the call to the API. 
- began working with Johanna to merge the Order class and my code. Everything seems to work fine, but would require more testing.

Next week:
- Together with all of interaction team, we will begin putting the whole parser together.

## Giuseppe Cognata
This week I:
- decided on the approach for further generalizations of our problem with the algorithm team, chose the relevant algorithms to implement these generalizations
- began implementing the k-means clustering algorithm using randomized initialization to optimize performance

Next week I plan to:
- finish the implementation of the k-means algorithm, which will allow us considerable generalization
- work on tidying up the code of the algorithms team
- work with the rest of the team to merge the various algos to solve a general instance of our problem

## Zarko Bulic
This week I:
- Continued working on the Blossom weighted algorithm
- Wrote a heuristic minimum-cost perfect matching algorithm (worse than the final goal but still efficant) so that the rest of the team can continue working on their parts

Next week I plan:
- Continue with the Blossom algorithm implementation

## Johanna Ulin
This week I:
- worked on finishing the order class
- began working with Mark to merge the Order class and the Geocoder API code. 
- updated to new QMake classes for the order parser
- started testing the csv converting with the order class and it is looking good so far. 

Next week I plan:
- Together with all of interaction team, we will begin putting the whole parser together.
- I will also be more nitpicky on the trello board as i feel like people could be taking it more serious, right now the trello board is a bit hard to follow, according to me. 

## Riho Marten Pallum
This week I:
  - Worked on converting the csv to order parser away from using QObjects
  - Put the parser together into one project and changed the compiler to Cmake
 Next week I plan:
 - To fix issues with using Cmake to compile

##  Pedro Cabral

This week I:
  Finished the implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem Approximation
  algorithm.

  Designed the algorithm to handle multiple inventories.

Next week I plan to:

  Implement the algorithm for multiple inventories.
  
## Mert Unsal
This week I:

- implemented the library based version of the Blossom V algorithm using the library for perfect min-cost matching.
- reviewed codes of other team members and made sure there are no faulty implementations in the software.
- worked on communication for successful merge between separate teams' codebases.
- worked on separating the file structure for different components and moving the necessary files to src folder.

Next week I plan to:
- work on implementing a new graph class to 
  - create a graph version of the OpenStreetMap API map
  - finding a matching node in the OpenStreetMap map for the orders 
  - running Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum path between the orders and the inventories

## Philippe Guyard
This week I:
  - Was fixing bugs in Mark's and Marten's code
  - Finished the CMake configuration to make the app runnable 
  - Found out that Mark's downloader was already asynchronous (hence no multithreading is needed for downloading)

Next week I plan to:
  - Write a testing library with Mark
  - Write a files manager with Johanna

## Nossaiba Kheiri
This week I : 
  -Created a route visualiser which displays a polyline on the map following the path of the route. 
  -worked on the prototype of the dashboard with the basic functionalities.
Next week: 
  -Merging all frontend developements as well as the frontend with the main app
