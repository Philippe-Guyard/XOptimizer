# Reports for the week ending 14/11/2021

## Pedro Cabral 

This week I:
  finished the implementation of the Graph Class
  added the necessary documentation to the graph.cpp file

Next week I plan to: 
  work on the implementation of the algorithms to have a first working
  version of the program.

## Philippe Guyard

This week I: 
    Was merging small scripts that Mark, Marten and Nykyta wrote to a single Interaction service class
    usable by our frontend team

Next week I plan to:  
    Implement multithreading in the Interaction service
    
## Mark Daychman
This week I:
  Learned about MultiPartHTTP requests in Qt. 
  I also found a French government API that returns a filled .csv file with all the information about the needed addresses.
  I began merging the downloader and the CSVSearcher into one wrapper class.
  
Next week I plan to:
  Finish merging the methods into one class. Currently, I cannot keep the QNetworkAccessManager alive between different method calls, i.e.
  One request is possible, but more than one method call breaks the whole program.

## Giuseppe Cognata

This week I:
  implemented Kruskal's algorithm to find a graph's minimum spanning tree, optimizing it by using improved implementations of disjoint union data structures.
  
 Next week I plan to:
  work with the rest of the algorithm team to get a first working implementation of the algorithm.
  
## Nossaiba Kheiri

This week: 
I worked visualising the output of the optimistion programm (address vector list) using a map with data from Openstreetmap.Created a map viewer of the grand hall of polytechnique campus (see playground/TestMap). Still working in coordination with Vilius on a prototype of the dashboard.

Next week: 
-Create a route visualiser which displays a polyline on the map following the path of the route.
-work on the prototype of the dashboard with the basic functionalities.

## Nguyen Doan Dai
This week I:
  - successfully employed Google Test framework, as well as writing CMakeLists.txt for building and testing purpose, 
  - implemented derived class RandomGraph allowing randomly generating undirected weighted graph,
  - independently implemented Disjoint-Set data structure and Prim's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree, 
  - wrote test cases for all implemented classes and methods up to the moment of writing (VertexData, Vertex, Edge, Graph, DisjointSet, and in particular Minimum Spanning Tree finding method), 
  - added the most up-to-date implementation of Blossom V algorithm (no mirror server with up-to-date version is known, hence the necessity for manual addition), 
  - found various issues in implementation of class methods and members, helping others in debugging.

Next week I plan to:
  - help others configuring testing environment in local machines if necessary,
  - build a CI/CD pipeline on GitHub,
  - add more test cases regarding edge cases of class methods,
  - finish testing current code base (assuming no significant changes in code base and known issues will be fixed), and moving them from ./test to ./src

## Zarko Bulic
This week I:
  Studied the Blossom algorithm for minimum cost perfect matching for weighted graphs, as well as how to implement primal-dual algorithms (linear programming). I also
  decided on the list of extra graph classes that will be needed for the algorithm
Next week:
  I plan to continue working on the blossom algorithm and by the end of the week have the bigger part implemented
