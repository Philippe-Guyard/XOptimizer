# Reports for the week ending 14/11/2021

## Pedro Cabral 

This week I:
  finished the implementation of the Graph Class
  added the necessary documentation to the graph.cpp file

Next week I plan to: 
  work on the implementation of the algorithms to have a first working
  version of the program.

## Philippe Guyard

This week I: 
    Was merging small scripts that Mark, Marten and Nykyta wrote to a single Interaction service class
    usable by our frontend team

Next week I plan to:  
    Implement multithreading in the Interaction service
    
## Mark Daychman
This week I:
  Learned about MultiPartHTTP requests in Qt. 
  I also found a French government API that returns a filled .csv file with all the information about the needed addresses.
  I began merging the downloader and the CSVSearcher into one wrapper class.
  
Next week I plan to:
  Finish merging the methods into one class. Currently, I cannot keep the QNetworkAccessManager alive between different method calls, i.e.
  One request is possible, but more than one method call breaks the whole program.

## Giuseppe Cognata

This week I:
  implemented Kruskal's algorithm to find a graph's minimum spanning tree, optimizing it by using improved implementations of disjoint union data structures.
  
 Next week I plan to:
  work with the rest of the algorithm team to get a first working implementation of the algorithm.
  
## Nossaiba Kheiri

This week: 
I worked visualising the output of the optimistion programm (address vector list) using a map with data from Openstreetmap.Created a map viewer of the grand hall of polytechnique campus (see playground/TestMap). Still working in coordination with Vilius on a prototype of the dashboard.

Next week: 
-Create a route visualiser which displays a polyline on the map following the path of the route.
-work on the prototype of the dashboard with the basic functionalities.
