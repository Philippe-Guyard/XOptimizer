# Reports for the week ending 14/11/2021

## Pedro Cabral 

This week I:
  finished the implementation of the Graph Class
  added the necessary documentation to the graph.cpp file

Next week I plan to: 
  work on the implementation of the algorithms to have a first working
  version of the program.

## Philippe Guyard

This week I: 
    Was merging small scripts that Mark, Marten and Nykyta wrote to a single Interaction service class
    usable by our frontend team

Next week I plan to:  
    Implement multithreading in the Interaction service
    
## Mark Daychman
This week I:
  Learned about MultiPartHTTP requests in Qt. 
  Found a French government API that allows a filled .csv file with all the information about the given addresses.
  I began merging the downloader and the CSVSearcher in one wrapper class.
  
Next week I plan to:
  Finish mergin the methods. Currently, I cannot keep the QNetworkAccessManager alive between different method calls, i.e.
  One request is possible, but more than one method call breaks the whole program.
